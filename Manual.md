## What is Ink Canvas? <span id='intro'></span>
Ink Canvas is a lightweight drawing software that is specifically optimized for the Showbie whiteboard device. Compared to the pre-installed "Seewo Whiteboard 5" software, it starts up much faster (improving by 5-10 times), takes up less system resources, and provides a better user experience.

You can zoom, drag, and even rotate with two fingers, and it is optimized for Microsoft PowerPoint. You can open a whiteboard or blackboard to write on while presenting slides, improving class efficiency. It has intelligent ink recognition technology that can recognize shapes like circles and automatically convert them.

Unified chalk writing experience in slideshow presentations and whiteboard/blackboard mode, creating unified operating habits.

### Ink Canvas mode

* **Slides Mode**
    * Supports pen, eraser, shape tools, quick page turning keys, automatic change of handwriting when changing pages, etc in Slides Mode.
    * Automatically saves ink under slides, ink will automatically recover when opened next time, and can be modified at any time.
    * If there are hidden slide pages, it will ask whether to unhide.
* **Drawing Board Mode (Black/Whiteboard Mode)**
    * There's a whole drawing board similar to a HiBoard whiteboard in Drawing Board Mode.
    * Supports adding new pages and page switching.
    * Supports multi-finger writing: The portrait icon in the lower left corner of the blackboard mode interface is the switch button.
	* The default is blackboard mode, you can change it to whiteboard in the settings.
* **Screen Pen Mode**
    * In Screen Pen Mode, you can display the original screen content while changing the mouse to pen writing to teach handwriting.

### Ink Canvas features
* One end of the pen can leave marks on the screen, while the thick end can be used as an eraser (erase by stroke), no need to manually switch modes
* If you find flipping the pen cumbersome, you can directly use your finger or tilt the pen tip to accurately erase a small range of ink
* The palm and fingers come together and directly placed on the screen, it's a big eraser (erase by area), the recognition speed and accuracy of this action is higher than "Shiwo whiteboard 5", touch and erase, no need to wait
* Fast startup speed
* Changing the brush color is more convenient, no need to click on the pen and then switch, clearing the screen is also more convenient
* Automatically kills some of Shiwo software
* Zoom, rotate, move, clone after selecting one or multiple strokes
* Full screen ink gesture scales with two fingers (rotation and dragging are also two-finger gestures)
* Graphic drawing (supports long press for continuous selection)
  Straight lines, dashed lines, and arrows
  Multiple parallel lines, circles with or without focus, hyperbolas, parabolas
  Circles, dashed circles, cylinders, cones, rectangular solids
  The coordinate system (Plane Coordinate System, Space Coordinate System)
* Ink to graphics, supports smart recognition of circles, triangles, special quadrilaterals, and automatically converts to a standard figure. It can automatically recognize concentric circles and tangent circles and automatically recognize sphere cross-section circles

### Ink Canvas features  
* **Countdown**: Aesthetically pleasing UI, and can be displayed in almost full-screen size.
* **Randomize**: You can import a list (recommended to use with Excel), and you can set the number of winners.
* **Save ink strokes**: Default save to ` Documents\Ink Canvas Strokes `
* **Screenshot**: In any mode (including mouse), click on the camera icon to take a screenshot and automatically save to ` Pictures\Ink Canvas Screenshots `, and you can turn on "Automatically save when taking a screenshot" in the settings.
* **Automatically save ink strokes in slideshow**: Default save to ` Documents\Ink Canvas Strokes `
* **Ink playback**: Automatically write all the ink on the screen from the beginning.


## Usage <span id='usage'></span>
### Pen Settings
* **Color**: In "Pen Mode", simply click on the color sphere on the main interface
* **Thickness**: Click on the "Settings" gear, adjust in "Drawing Board"-"Pen Thickness", default is 5
* **Nib**: In the "Settings" gear, there are nibs drawn according to "Speed" and "Tail" to make the strokes more beautiful
### Use of Eraser
* **Trace Erasure**: Click once to turn the icon gray and erase the content by trace
* **Range Erasure**: Click multiple times to turn the icon blue and erase the range according to the prompt pattern
* **Palm Erasure**: Press the palm in pen mode to achieve eraser erasure function (not supported on some screens)
### Draw Preset Shapes
* **Perfect Circle**: When determining the circle center, you can opt to click on a preset at the "Origin" position and then drag the mouse to complete the perfect circle drawing
* **Parabola**: Click on the "Origin" position and then drag the mouse
* **Hyperbola**: Click and drag the mouse at the "Origin" position, first determine the asymptote, then determine the real axis and imaginary axis
* **Ellipse**: Click and drag the mouse at the "Origin" position, then determine the major and minor axes (Ellipse and Hyperbola can both choose to preset with or without focus display)
* **Rectangular**: First determine the front view, then click again to determine the side view width
* **Cone, Cylinder**: All at once
* **Plane Cartesian Coordinate System**: Multiple presets are available, the extended lines at the intersection of the two lines in the icon represent the actual drawing side.
* **Space Cartesian Coordinate System**: Draw all three axes simultaneously
* **Parallel Lines**: From one end to the other, suitable for drawing uniform electric field lines, and optimized for special angles
### PPT Slide Mode
* **Page Turning**: When there are no pen traces on the screen, you can swipe up and down with multiple fingers to turn pages, as well as control buttons and keyboard direction keys to turn pages
* **Save**: Pen traces in PPT are automatically saved, and you can also move the pen trace folder to another computer for normal use with the original pen traces
The built-in drawing board opened in PPT mode is the same as the normal one, which may require users to pay attention to saving issues themselves
### Automatic Ink Recognition (Ink To Shape)
1. Draw as standard and regular as possible
2. Drawing an ellipse inside a perfect circle can complete the recognition of cross-section circle and concentric ellipse (applicable to celestial trajectory)
3. Can automatically complete the recognition of concentric circles, tangent circles (internal tangent, external tangent)

### Preview Interface

## Tips <span id='skill'></span>
1. Double click the "Clear Screen" button to hide the sketchpad while clearing the screen, equivalent to clicking the "Clear Screen" and "Hide Sketchpad" buttons.
2. If you accidentally erase something, click the "Undo" button to retract it, clicking again will restore it.
3. If you need to close the Ink Canvas, you can find the button to close it in the settings.
4. At any time, click the "Blackboard" button to enter the blackboard.
5. If there isn't enough space to write, you can slide up with two fingers to move the existing ink, or you can zoom in with two fingers to make room.
6. Can't find the "Eraser" button? The pen upside down is the eraser !If you find it troublesome to roll over the pen, you can directly use your fingertip or tilt the pen tip to erase small range of ink. Large range can be erased by bringing fingers together to use palm or back of hand, even blackboard erasers, wiping towel to complete it. It is suggested to use the back of the hand rather than the palm because there is more sweat on the palm, which may cause more friction when sliding on the screen, and larger contact area may cause misrecognition as multi-finger (multi-finger zooming) problem.
